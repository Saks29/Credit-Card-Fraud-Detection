# Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Machine Learning Approach

## Overview

This project delves into the critical area of credit card fraud detection, leveraging the power of machine learning and data science techniques. Inspired by groundbreaking research in the field, my goal was to build an intelligent system capable of identifying fraudulent transactions, thereby contributing to the security of e-commerce and digital payments.

## Inspiration & Motivation

My journey into this project was significantly influenced by the insightful research presented in the journal:

  * **"A machine learning based credit card fraud detection using the GA algorithm for feature selection"** by Emmanuel Ileberi, Yanxia Sun, and Zenghui Wang (Journal of Big Data (2022) 9:24).

This paper illuminated the crucial role of advanced feature selection techniques, specifically the Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the effectiveness of various machine learning classifiers in tackling the complex problem of credit card fraud. Motivated by their rigorous methodology and promising results, I embarked on this data analysis and machine learning endeavor to apply and explore these concepts firsthand, adapting them to build my own robust fraud detection engine.

## Features

This project implements a comprehensive approach to fraud detection, including:

  * **Optimized Feature Selection with Genetic Algorithm (GA):** Following the inspiration from the journal, a key focus was on intelligently selecting the most relevant features using the Genetic Algorithm. This process enhances model performance, reduces noise, and improves computational efficiency.
  * **Ensemble of Machine Learning Classifiers:** To ensure robust detection capabilities, the project evaluates and utilizes a range of powerful machine learning algorithms:
      * Decision Tree (DT)
      * Random Forest (RF)
      * Logistic Regression (LR)
      * Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
      * Naive Bayes (NB)
      * **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):** Included for its high performance and effectiveness in classification tasks, as explored during the project's development [cite: uploaded:Credit-Card-Fault-Detection.ipynb].
  * **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing:** Addresses challenges inherent in real-world transaction data, such as handling irrelevant columns and, crucially, managing the significant class imbalance often found in fraud datasets (e.g., by balancing true transactions) [cite: uploaded:Credit-Card-Fault-Detection.ipynb].
  * **Rigorous Performance Evaluation:** Model effectiveness is meticulously assessed using standard classification metrics, providing a clear understanding of the detection engine's accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for analysis and experimentation.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python installed on your system. The project relies on several popular Python libraries for data handling, machine learning, and visualization.

```bash
python --version
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Saks29/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
    cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (highly recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost
    ```

## Usage

### Data

The core of this project relies on transaction data. The Jupyter Notebook is configured to load a dataset, typically a CSV file (e.g., `dataset.csv` as referenced in the notebook) [cite: uploaded:Credit-Card-Fault-Detection.ipynb]. Ensure your dataset contains relevant features and a 'Class' column indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

### Running the Analysis

1.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  **Open the project notebook:**
    In your web browser, navigate to and open `PythonNotebook/Credit-Card-Fault-Detection.ipynb`.
3.  **Execute cells:**
    Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom. This will guide you through the data loading, preprocessing steps, model training (including balancing the dataset), and the final evaluation of the fraud detection models.

## Key Technologies & Libraries

  * **Python:** The foundational language for all data analysis and machine learning tasks.
  * **Pandas:** Essential for efficient data manipulation and analysis [cite: uploaded:Credit-Card-Fault-Detection.ipynb].
  * **NumPy:** Provides robust support for numerical operations and array computations [cite: uploaded:Credit-Card-Fault-Detection.ipynb].
  * **Scikit-learn:** A comprehensive library for machine learning, offering various models, metrics (`accuracy_score`, `precision_score`, `recall_score`), and utilities (`classification_report`) [cite: uploaded:Credit-Card-Fault-Detection.ipynb].
  * **XGBoost:** A highly optimized gradient boosting library known for its speed and performance in structured data [cite: uploaded:Credit-Card-Fault-Detection.ipynb].
  * **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Used for creating insightful visualizations of the data and model performance [cite: uploaded:Credit-Card-Fault-Detection.ipynb].

## Model Training and Evaluation Flow

The Jupyter Notebook systematically demonstrates the following pipeline:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Loading the transaction dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Initial Data Exploration & Cleaning:** Examining the data, and performing operations like dropping non-essential columns (e.g., 'Time') [cite: uploaded:Credit-Card-Fault-Detection.ipynb].
3.  **Addressing Class Imbalance:** A crucial step in fraud detection, where the number of legitimate transactions vastly outweighs fraudulent ones. The notebook shows how the dataset is balanced (e.g., by reducing the sample of 'True Transactions') to prevent models from being biased towards the majority class [cite: uploaded:Credit-Card-Fault-Detection.ipynb].
4.  **Model Instantiation & Training:** Defining and fitting the chosen machine learning models (e.g., the XGBoost model demonstrated in the snippet) on the prepared data [cite: uploaded:Credit-Card-Fault-Detection.ipynb].
5.  **Prediction:** Generating predictions on unseen test data.
6.  **Performance Assessment:** Calculating and reporting key metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and a detailed Classification Report to comprehensively evaluate the model's effectiveness in identifying fraud [cite: uploaded:Credit-Card-Fault-Detection.ipynb].

## Results

Through this project, I've aimed to develop a credit card fraud detection system that exhibits high accuracy and strong generalization capabilities. The meticulous data preparation and strategic application of machine learning models, influenced by the journal's methodology, have led to a system well-equipped to identify fraudulent patterns.
